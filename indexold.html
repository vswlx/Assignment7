        Hello!  My  name is Brian Chiang.  I am a Computer Science student at UMass Lowell, and this website is a project for a course I am taking, GUI Programming I.  This site will act as a library for future assignments in the course among other things.  This site is simple now, but it will slowly grow as the semester progresses, so be sure to check up on it now and then!
